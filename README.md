This is a website built for Praveen Hiralall, a car salesman at kia.

I decided to help a family member with their work in order to make more sales, whilst this webpage isn't the best for admins since it can only be updated with code I used it as a learning platform for webpage development and I am happy with the way things tturned out.
This was a sort of "gift" to Praveen and I am glad that my skills are not just used for the job but to help others first.
